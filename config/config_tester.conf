# - / must answer to GET request ONLY
# - /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice
# - any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable
# - /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
# - /directory/ must answer to GET request and the root of it would be the repository YoupiBanane
#    and if no file are requested, it should search for youpi.bad_extension files
